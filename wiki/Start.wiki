Why to use html canvas interface?

The Html 5 is a VERY STRONG STANDARD. There are many devices like tablets smart phones and different OS implementing Html 5 compatible browsers. It means that every device is going to support the drawing as specified in the canvas element. For this reason, canvas interface itâ€™s a safe choice very documented with a lot of samples available in the web. 

Why C++?

C++ is an ISO standard language with good abstractions and very fast. It is used by a large number of platforms including Windows, Mac, Linux, IOs etc. 
These characteristics make C++ a perfect choice  to create applications that reuse code between different platforms and at the same time have access to native features and the best performance.

Why Canvas++?


Although many devices have a screen in common (most of them have a web browser as well) there is no standard native way to draw on the screen.  
The canvas++ will allow C++ programmers to collaborate and have the same standard interface used on the web to drawing on the screen.



===HTML 5 Reference===
